# join-the-techblog

## Description
The purpose of this project was to learn to create a Tech Blog application that allows users to sign up and sign in to create their own blog entries, comment on the entries of other users, and update or delete both their entries and their comments. Users may change their password when logged in. Visitors without an account (and signed out users) can still view all the existing entries and comments, but may not make any changes to either. This functionality is ideal for maintaining any public collection viewable by anyone, but only accessible to authorized and authenticated users for edits.
